# DayTrading Bot

An automated day trading bot using Alpaca's paper trading API to safely test trading algorithms without risking real money.

## ðŸš¨ SAFETY FIRST ðŸš¨

This bot is configured to use **PAPER TRADING ONLY**. It will never use real money. The bot connects to Alpaca's paper trading environment where you can test strategies with virtual money.

## Trading Algorithm: Simple Moving Average Crossover

The bot implements a classic and simple moving average crossover strategy:

### How It Works:
1. **Short-term Moving Average (5-period)**: Tracks recent price trends
2. **Long-term Moving Average (20-period)**: Tracks longer-term price trends
3. **Buy Signal**: When the short MA crosses above the long MA
4. **Sell Signal**: When the short MA crosses below the long MA

### Why This Strategy:
- **Simple to understand**: Easy to verify and debug
- **Well-tested**: Classic strategy used by many traders
- **Risk-aware**: Uses clear entry/exit signals
- **Conservative**: Only trades one symbol (SPY - S&P 500 ETF)

### Trading Rules:
- Only trades during market hours (9:30 AM - 4:00 PM ET)
- Uses small position sizes (10 shares) for testing
- Automatically closes positions on sell signals (no shorting for safety)
- Logs all activities for review
